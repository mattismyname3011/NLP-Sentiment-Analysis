<h3 align="center">Natural Language Processing - Analysis Sentiment</h3>

<p align="justify">&emsp;&emsp;Natural language processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to comprehend, generate, and manipulate human language. Natural language processing has the ability to interrogate the data with natural language text or voice.  NLP is the core technology behind virtual assistants, such as the Oracle Digital Assistant (ODA), Siri, Cortana, or Alexa. When we ask questions of these virtual assistants, NLP is what enables them to not only understand the user’s request, but to also respond in natural language. Other examples of tools powered by NLP include web search, email spam filtering, automatic translation of text or speech, document summarization, sentiment analysis, and grammar/spell checking. <a href="https://www.oracle.com/id/artificial-intelligence/what-is-natural-language-processing/#:~:text=Natural%20language%20processing%20(NLP)%20is,natural%20language%20text%20or%20voice.">(Oracle, 2023)</a>.</p>

<p align="justify">&emsp;&emsp;Sentiment analysis is a NLP technique used to determine whether data is positive, negative or neutral. Sentiment analysis is often performed on textual data to help businesses monitor brand and product sentiment in customer feedback, and understand customer needs. Since humans express their thoughts and feelings more openly than ever before, sentiment analysis is fast becoming an essential tool to monitor and understand sentiment in all types of data. Automatically analyzing customer feedback, such as opinions in survey responses and social media conversations, allows brands to learn what makes customers happy or frustrated, so that they can tailor products and services to meet their customers’ needs. For example, using sentiment analysis to automatically analyze 4,000+ open-ended responses in your customer satisfaction surveys could help you discover why customers are happy or unhappy at each stage of the customer journey<a href="https://monkeylearn.com/sentiment-analysis/">(MonkeyLearn, 2023)</a>.</p>

<summary style="font-weight:bold;">Sorting Data at Scale</summary>
<p style="margin-left:15px">Can you imagine manually sorting through thousands of tweets, customer support conversations, or surveys? There’s just too much business data to process manually. Sentiment analysis helps businesses process huge amounts of unstructured data in an efficient and cost-effective way.</p>

<details style="">
<summary style="font-weight:bold;">Real-Time Analysis</summary>
<p style="margin-left:15px">Sentiment analysis can identify critical issues in real-time, for example is a PR crisis on social media escalating? Is an angry customer about to churn? Sentiment analysis models can help you immediately identify these kinds of situations, so you can take action right away.

<summary style="font-weight:bold;">Consistent criteria</summary>
<p style="margin-left:15px">It’s estimated that people only agree around 60-65% of the time when determining the sentiment of a particular text. Tagging text by sentiment is highly subjective, influenced by personal experiences, thoughts, and beliefs. By using a centralized sentiment analysis system, companies can apply the same criteria to all of their data, helping them improve accuracy and gain better insights.</p>

The applications of sentiment analysis are endless. So, to help you understand how sentiment analysis could benefit your business, let’s take a look at some examples of texts that you could analyze using sentiment analysis. Then, we’ll jump into a real-world example of how Chewy, a pet supplies company, was able to gain a much more nuanced (and useful!) understanding of their reviews through the application of sentiment analysis.</p>
